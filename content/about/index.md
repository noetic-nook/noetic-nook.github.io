## Recognition

It gives me immense joy to write this preface. I am turning 81 this year. With a pen in hand, I am reflecting on my life, my life as a daughter, sister, spouse, daughter-in-law, a mother and many other roles I got to play in my lifetime. Today I feel so proud writing this note for my daughter, Parveen, on the occasion of the launch of Noetic Nook. Parveen has enjoyed writing from her school days, her poems and articles were published in school magazines, she has written poems for everyday heroes in her life, including her parents, teachers, colleagues and friends. I am so happy that even after moving to America, she decided to write these in Hindi for little children. The poems reflect on things around little children, the relationships in their lives, and themes arousing curiosity in young minds. I congratulate Parveen on publishing 'Chumbak' and wish her the best to keep writing. 

With Love,<br>
Pramila Bindra
